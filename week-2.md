## Week 2 

### Characteristics of a Wave

- Basic high school level physics but good to refresh your memory as understanding the relationship between wavelength and frequency is useful. [Khan Academy link](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-mechanical-waves-and-sound/wave-characteristics-ap/a/wave-characteristics-review-ap-physics-1) 
- [Frequency wavelength calculator](https://www.easycalculation.com/physics/electromagnetism/antenna-wavelength.php) . A useful tool to get a sense of how big of an antenna you need to pick up a given frequency
- Its worth highlighting that understanding how radio waves propagate and designing antenna's is a whole science in itself. If you are curious to learn more I highly recommend the following videos from the Canandian Royal Air Force:

  - 2 [Directivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=md7GjQQ2YA0)
  - 3 [Bandwidth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iV_YICgifA)

### Electromagnetic Spectrum

- [FCC spectrum allocation chart](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/2003-allochrt.pdf)
- [Frequency Database](https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/) to look up the radio licenses somewhere in the US

### Modulation

-  [FM Basic Principals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfz1FbIOMbs&t=635s) video we watched in class

### Software Defined Radios

- [WebSDR](http://websdr.ewi.utwente.nl:8901/)
- Jon Keegan's excellent [Github repository](https://github.com/jonkeegan/exploring-the-spectrum) from his *Exploring the Radio Spectrum for News* workshop. This has all the stuff you need to get started plus some really good news examples but I'm pulling out some particularly useful resources here
- [GQRX tips and tricks](gqrx.dk/doc/practical-tricks-and-tips)
- [Hobbyist's Guide To RTL-SDR](https://www.amazon.com/Hobbyists-Guide-RTL-SDR-Software-Defined-ebook/dp/B00KCDF1QI)
- [SDR-101 Github Repository](https://github.com/samatt/SDR-101) from many years ago. Mostly redundant now but still has some useful information about the hardware that is available
- [Satellite Sounds](https://dhruvmehrotra.info/satellite-sounds/index.html) - Dhruv Mehrotra



### Digital Modulation

- Super technical digital modulation [white paper](https://www.iith.ac.in/~tbr/teaching/docs/DigitalModulation-WhitePaper.pdf)
- [NOAA weather Satellite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=tHDFHc3JgpY&feature=emb_logo)
