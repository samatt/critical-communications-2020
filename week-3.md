## Week 3



### Standards Bodies & Regulatory Institutions

- [Old wired article on standards bodies](https://www.wired.com/1997/08/standards-bodies-a-field-guide/)
- Cloudflare blog post on the [OSI model](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/open-systems-interconnection-model-osi/)
- [Old blog post](http://networks.land/reference/packets/) I wrote that describes packet switching and encapsulation. Not directly related but might be helpful to better understand how what role the different OSI payers play in transporting data packets across the internet.
- IETF [Mission Statement](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3935)
- [FCC data portal](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/data)
- FCC [License viewer](http://reboot.fcc.gov/license-view/) portal
- [FCC.io](http://fcc.io) - Easier to use FCC ID lookup website
- [Spectrum Wrangler](https://github.com/marcdacosta/spectrum-wrangler)
- [EFF Letter to W3C](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/09/open-letter-w3c-director-ceo-team-and-membership
)
- Marc DaCosta's write up on [How to Explore the Hidden World of Radio Waves](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59wpmn/how-to-explore-the-hidden-world-of-radio-waves-all-around-you) 
- Dump 1090
- - [Github repository](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) for the Dump1090 demo I did in class
  - This [repository](https://github.com/mxswd/dump1090-mac-app) claims to contain a standalone Mac App that wraps the tool. Try it at your own risk! 
- Code for [Ambient Shipping](https://github.com/marcdacosta/ambient-shipping). The Enigma Public API doesn't seem to exist any longer but this repository is still useful if you want to get a better understanding of how to decode AIS signals. 
- Samy Kamkar's [DEF CON talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNgvShN4USU).
- [Protocol](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/protocol), Alexander Galloway
- A [crazy story](http://www.radiohobbyist.org/blog/?p=913) about how Brazillian pirates used US military relay satellites to broadcast messages
