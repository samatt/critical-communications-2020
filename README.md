# :artificial_satellite: Critical Communications :satellite:

**Term**: Spring 2020,  NYU ITP

**Meetings**: Monday, 6:30 - 9:00pm



## Description

The ways in which we communicate has changed radically in the last  100 years. As the communication systems we use have increased in  complexity, so has the effort it takes to understand how they work. Most  of us use protocols like LTE, HTTP, TCP/IP, and BLE every day. We take  them for granted, almost like we do the laws of nature. But there are  more than the laws of physics, more than techniques of engineering,  embedded in the design and implementation of our protocols of  communication. To understand their role in our lives, we need to look  into the societal and economic contexts in which they came to be.

In this class, we will examine communication protocols using  Raspberry Pi’s, Arduinos, Software Defined Radios, and other connected  devices. We will look closer at organizations like iSOC, ICANN and IEEE  to better understand how protocol designs are implemented and  standardized. Through readings, research and hands-on work we will build  an understanding of how these protocols work, how their designs  incorporate the physical, technical, cultural, corporate and political  assumptions of the actors behind them.

In the first half of the class readings and assignments will help  familiarize students with some of the different protocols we rely on  every day. In the second half, students will work in groups to  investigate a communications protocol and consider its impact from a  technical, societal and environmental perspective. Final projects will  communicate their findings in whatever form students deem appropriate –   explanatory blog posts, physical or digital installations, or even  videos and podcasts.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1

#### Discussion

- :wave: Introduction
- Description of Group Project
- An introduction communication technologies and information theory. A walk through of some key events in the evolution of our current technology landscape. Marconi to Hedy Lamar to Claude Shannon
- [Notes](week1.md)

#### Assignment

Research a communications protocol of your choice and write it up what you find in a blog post. Questions to answer (at the very least):

- How does it work? 
  - Doesn't need to be super technical but it should be detailed enough that to understand how someone could use it.  
- Who made it?
- Why was it made?
- What did you find interesting about it?

For the purpose of this assignment a communications protocol will be defined as *a system of rules that allow two or more entities of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity* (Source: Wikipedia)
