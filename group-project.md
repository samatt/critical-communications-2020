## **Group Project**

Produce an explainer that describes a communication protocol of your choosing and the ways in which it impacts the communities it is used by. Imagine you are creating this for a general audience to help them gain a better understanding of the protocol and the role it plays in people's lives.

The explainer can either take the form of an article or a video.  If you are writing an article you should adhere to the guidelines Tom has for the explanatory article assignment in[ Understanding Networks](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/undnet/syllabus/assignments/):     

*Your article should be 750 – 1500 words, and include links to and* 

*citations of any material from which you learn. Use primary sources when*

*possible, and remember that Wikipedia is not a primary source. Explain* 

*in your own words; do not simply quote your sources*

If you're making a video it should be no less than 2 min but no longer than 5 min. 

You can also add interactive components or data visualizations if you think they will help with the explanation, if you’re writing an article these could be included inline, if you’re making a video these could live on a different page that you link to from wherever the video is hosted.

If you want to go with a different format you should ask me first and have a reasonable explanation for your choice.
